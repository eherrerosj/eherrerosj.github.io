_"In the four-hour version of THE ASCENT OF MONEY, historian and author Niall Ferguson seeks to explain the financial history of the world, exploring how our complex system of global finance evolved over the centuries, how money has shaped the course of human affairs and how the mechanics of this economic system work to create seemingly unlimited wealth or catastrophic loss."_

- Spanish Conquerors failed to see that money is about trust - even faith. Trust in the person paying you the money, trust in the central bank issuing the money, trust in the commercial bank that honours the cheque. Money isn't metal. It's trust inscribed
- Our entire civilization is based on the concept of borrowing money. "Credit" comes from latin word "credo", which means _believe_. A revolution started
- Fibonacci explained the application of mathematics to making money and how the arabic numerical system was superior to the roman's. The former was preferred to financials
- For christians, the fact that jews were lending money with an interest, was a sin. Started in Venice, considered a jew ghetto
- In Florence, the Medici were the ones that made money lending glorious and the foundation of a new kind of power
- "Bank" comes from "bench" in which the money exchangers were sitting, in the streets
- The church prohibited interest collection and 5 Medicis were setenced to death for capital crimes. Financing foreign trade was the hack, no interest, just a comission on the exchange
- Depositors who put their money in the Medici bank were given 'discrezione' to compensate them for risking their money
- Money lending had evolved into banking!
- Increasing their scale and diversification of the operations is what allowed them to reduce risk of default due to a single big bad borrower
- Bond market arose to finance war
- Florence citizens became the best state investors. Public debt problem seemed to be solved, but they depended on the amount of bonds (more bonds means less value) and from the war outcomes (if war is not lucrative enough, neither are the bonds)
- Amsterdam. Worlds first central bank to help finance their war against Spain and to protect their merchants from dodge coinage
- In 1716, Law introduced the bank — the Banque Générale — and gave France its first experience with paper money. The following year, he established France’s first modern corporation — the Company of the West — to develop French America. In two bounds, France had drawn level with its great rival England, whose own national bank had already been printing banknotes for two decades, and where joint stock companies were more than a century old
- A market for the company shares was created 4 centuries ago as a consequence o the first Company: United Dutch East India Chartered Company. The price of shares were determined by the laws of demand and supply, by buyers and sellers
- John Law noticed, the trading of these company stocks was making the world's first shareholders very rich. By 1610, the world's first joint stock company, the Dutch East lndia Company, was ready to conquer the world
- Law thought that it made no sense to restrict the number of East India Company shares when the markets were so clearle enamoured of them. Law was also puzzled by the conservatism of the Bank of Amsterdam, which hadn't issued any real banknotes to the public
- In 1716, John Law arrived in Paris. He had identified France as the ideal laboratory for what would be the biggest experiment in the history of the stock market
- French trusted him because they were desperate with their huge public debt as a result of the wars of Luis XIV
- New bank would issue paper money. As money was invested in the bank, the government's huge debt wouId be consolidated
- Consolidation simply meant that its onerous debts were magically transformed into shares in Law's bank. At the same time, the monarch gained the ability to print as much money as he liked
- John Law made a scheme, similar to Ponzi, where he would issue as many shares as needed because he was in control of his bank, the money printing machine too and had public confidence. Until his bubble burst the stock market
- "The emperor of the XIX cent bond market, the Bonaparte of finance", Nathan Rothschild, did a great breakthrough in finance on mix of genius, focus and UKs war. He was given the job of converting paper money from the government bonds and converting it to Wellington as gold
- Rothschild acquired a lot of gold thinking that the Battle of Waterloo was going to be long, and that the value of gold was going to appreciate in time because the goverment would need more and more currency to pay the war. But the battle of Waterloo was very brief, and the Rothschild were now sitting in a pile of cash that nobody wanted
- Rothschild, with all this cash, bought a crazy amount of goverment bonds and held it for 1 year, selling it later at an increased value of +40%
- During America's Civil Wars, the credit system in the South, based on the so-called "crop lien" (whereby people borrow money pledging the future cotton crop as their collateral to a merchant), leads to over-production of cotton and further declines in the price
- Not only that, the bond market was now backend by cotton. Cotton had become the most valuable crop of the South and comprised 59% of the exports from the United States. In order to starve the world of cotton. Believing in the power of King Cotton, the Confederates placed an embargo on cotton exports in the summer of 1861. British manufacturers sought other supplies. The shortfall in shipments from America stimulated cotton production in India, Egypt, and Brazil, which all increased their production in order to meet British demands
- The blockade had a significant impact on the South. People across the South were suffering from a lack of supplies and their economy profoundly suffered. This included the army, where many of the men were nearing starvation by the end of the war
- Aristocrats didn't see that property is only a security to the person who lends you money. As a borrower, you still have to own the money to pay back the loan. The debt got so high that palaces were confiscated and its internals, bargained
