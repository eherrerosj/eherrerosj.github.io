I'm a 7 years experienced Software / Machine Learning Engineer working at Electric Capital, a top-notch Crypto VC. I have proven success in building and deploying software specially around algorithms, predictive models and bringing ideas to reality. In my past life I was a Kaggle _Expert_ (ranking top 3% in the world). Now I'm fully dedicated to crypto and blockchain stuff.

Between 2018 and 2021, I co-founded 2 startups: [Shalion](https://shalion.com) and [Xplore.ai](https://xplore.ai). Before 2018, I built Machine Learning apps for [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com) and [FindHotel](https://findhotel.net). Some important learnings:
1. How to quickly zoom in from the whole picture to low-level details
2. The value of team cohesion and trust
3. Learn to thrive in chaos, deal with ambiguity & find my way with little or none guidance
4. Knowing when to politely say "no" ∝ focus ∝ productivity. Eg: meetings != collaboration
5. Hard work and learning **always** pays off because it compounds


**What am I up to?**
- Crypto, blockchain, NFT, Smart Contracts and DAOs  
- Settled in Toronto. Before that I was travelling around Canary Islands and Portugal, lived a couple years in Barcelona, 1 year in Amsterdam. Most of life has happened in Madrid  
- Learning Solidity. Trying to deploy something into the testnet and figure out next steps fro
- (Inconsistently) learning Portuguese
