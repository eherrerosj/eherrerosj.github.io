I'm a 6+ years experienced Machine Learning Engineer with proven success in building and deploying algorithms, predictive models and bringing ideas to reality.  I'm a Kaggle _Expert_ (ranking top 3% in the world).  

I co-founded 2 ML/Data startups: [Shalion](https://shalion.com) and [Xplore.ai](https://xplore.ai). I have built Machine Learning apps for [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com) and [FindHotel](https://findhotel.net). Such company diversity taught me a wide variaty of things. Let me tell you my top 5:
1. How to quickly zoom in from the whole picture to low-level details
2. The value of team cohesion and trust
3. Learn to thrive in chaos, deal with ambiguity & create structures
4. Knowing when to politely say "no" ‚àù focus ‚àù productivity. Eg: meetings != collaboration
5. Hard work and learning **always** pays off and compounds


**What am I currently learning / trying to improve?**
- FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
- No-code frontends. Thrilled with the idea of publishing a project that uses at least one of: [retool](https://retool.com/), [datasette.io](https://docs.datasette.io), [Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/). Feeling curious ü§î with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Kitesurf. The joy is real. But still can't jump
- Portuguese (because of my girlfriend üáßüá∑). I'm using [Duolingo](https://apps.apple.com/es/app/duolingo/id570060128) and [Pimsleur](https://www.pimsleur.com/)
- Machine Learning. Always have time for an interesting Kaggle competition. Now involved in [Shopee - Price Match Guarantee (Determine if two products are the same by their images)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shopee-product-matching)
- Basic investment. Just learning basic [patterns](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/092315/5-most-powerful-candlestick-patterns.asp), where to [look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBBXmim527A) in a balance sheet and income statements. Not getting into bitcoin though :)

**Learning backlog**
- Basic piano
- Bouldering
- Improve at cooking. For now, I can manage the [Thermomix ü§ñ](https://cookidoo.es) at least
- Improve snowboarding / learn skiing
- Take sailing lessons. Legally I'm allowed to pilot up to 23m boats but I need to practice! ü§∑
