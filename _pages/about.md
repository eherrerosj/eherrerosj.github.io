I'm a 6+ years experienced Machine Learning Engineer with proven success in building and deploying algorithms, predictive models and bringing ideas to reality.  I'm a Kaggle _Expert_ (ranking top 3% in the world).  

I co-founded 2 ML/Data startups: [Shalion](https://shalion.com) and [Xplore.ai](https://xplore.ai). I have built Machine Learning apps for [Deloitte](https://www.deloitte.com) and [FindHotel](https://findhotel.net). Such company diversity taught me a wide variaty of things. Let me tell you my top 5:
1. How to quickly zoom in from the whole picture to low-level details
2. The value of team cohesion and trust
3. Learn to thrive in chaos, deal with ambiguity & create structures
4. Knowing when to politely say "no" ∝ focus ∝ productivity. Eg: meetings != collaboration
5. Hard work and learning **always** pays off because it compounds

**What am I up to?**
- SaaS + Ecommerce + Data 🚀. Most often within this triangle. I'm always happy to talk about this, <a href='https://t.me/eherrerosj'>ping me</a> if you think I can be helpful
- Moving around. After 2 years living in Barcelona we became remote for a while: now we are for 1 month in Canary islands (<a href='/assets/images/about/fuerteventura1.jpg'>Fuerteventura</a> and Lanzarote), then 1 month in Porto and then who knows
- Learning Ruby. Will soon tell you why 👨🏻‍💻. In the meantime I'm practicing - this blog uses it, and I'm also developing an app to unfollow inactive twitter friends :) -
- (Inconsistently) learning Portuguese (🇧🇷 partner). I'm using Duolingo and Pimsleur
- Got a bit into cryptos, couldn't help it 🤷🏻‍♂️


**Hobbies**
- Kitesurf. I learned how to <a href='/assets/images/about/kitesurf.jpg'>jump</a>. Still learning how to land though 😂
- Always up for a squash or padel match 🎾
- Backlog: I want to take bouldering lessons, buy a bike when we settle back and improve snowboarding
